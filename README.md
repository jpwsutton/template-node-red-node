# template-node-red-node
This is a template node-RED node that can be used when creating your own node



It's based off the https://github.com/jpwsutton/node-red-contrib-surepet node, and will not work if you just try to install it like it is. This is just some example files that are useful for bootstrapping node development, because I'm lazy.
